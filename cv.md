## Briefly About Myself:

I came into development at the age of 35, before that I was engaged in archeology as an illustrator. My career started as a content manager in mass media, I had to fill the site with news via CMS. Having become slightly acquainted with how the web works, I immediately realized that it is exciting. Since then I have been constantly studying front-end development in courses and on my own. I became junior frontend developer in my company and apply new knowledge in HTML, CSS and JS every day. I really like to develop my knowledge and professional skills and I am not going to stop there!

## My skills:

- HTML5 (including Pug)
- CSS3 (including Sass, Less, BEM methodology).
- JavaScript (Basics, Fundamentals).
- Version control: Git, GitHub.
- Module Bundlers: Gulp.

## Code example:

```
KATA from CODEWARS: The task is to sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in descending order.
function sumOfDifferences(arr) {
  let result = 0;
  if (arr.length <= 1) return result;
  arr.sort(function (a, b) {
    return b - a;
  });
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {
    result += arr[i] - arr[i+1];
  }
  return result;
}
```
